            <p>Dreepy is a small, green Pok√©mon resembling a reptile or amphibian. It has yellow eyes, pink horns, and a
                light green tail with two hand-like protrusions at the front of its body, while its head is a darker
                green. Its tail also possesses a darker green area with three protrusions surrounding it.
                Dreepy are reborn ghosts of a prehistoric species that once lived in ancient seas. It tends to wander
                the locations where it once lived after it is reborn. Dreepy are exceptionally weak in combat, so much
                that on its own, a mere child could defeat it. However, it has the potential to become much stronger and
                evolve if it has friends to help it train.
                Dreepy can often be seen fighting alongside its evolutionary relatives Drakloak and Dragapult. The
                latter even launches Dreepy at Mach speeds, which the Dreepy enjoy.
